Welcome to my analysis on the Japan's 2020 census data.

Findings from the analysis are found in the Power BI Dashboards pdf within the Power BI folder.

The data and python cleaning jupyter notebook are found in the data folder, SQL scripts for cleaning and manipulating the data are found in the SQL Scripts folder. Finally the Excel folder contains our Excel sheet for analysis plus some exported csv files from excel.

The data comes from this source: https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/stat-search/database?page=1&toukei=00200521&tstat=000001136464
